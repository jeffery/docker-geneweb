# [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) [Geneweb](https://geneweb.tuxfamily.org/wiki/GeneWeb)

![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jeffernz/geneweb.svg?style=for-the-badge)

GeneWeb is a free multi-platform genealogy software tool created and owned by Daniel de Rauglaudre of INRIA. GeneWeb is 
accessed by a Web browser, either off-line or as a server in a Web environment.

## Running from pre-compiled docker image

Ensure you have [docker environment](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) setup on your desktop/server

### Download the docker image
```
docker pull jeffernz/geneweb:latest
```

### Running the docker image

When running the geneweb dockerized container, you will need a location to save your geneweb databases on you local 
desktop/server. For this we can pick a location in your home directory. e.g. `~/GenealogyData`

To launch the container, execute the following in your favourite shell:

```
docker run -d \
    --name jeffernz-geneweb \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 2316:2316 -p 2317:2317 \
    -v ~/GenealogyData:/usr/local/var/geneweb \
    jeffernz/geneweb:latest
```

If you are accessing GeneWeb setup from a different host, add the environment variable `HOST_IP` to the run command. e.g.

```
--env HOST_IP=192.168.0.10
```

If you need to run GeneWeb in a different language, add the environment variable `LANGUAGE` to the run command. e.g.

```
--env LANGUAGE=en
```

If you need to run GeneWeb in a different timezone, add the environment variable `TZ` to the run command. e.g.

```
--env TZ=Australia/Melbourne
```

## Running from source repository

Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [docker environment](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) setup on your desktop/server

### Download source, build and run

```
git clone https://github.com/jeffery/docker-geneweb.git && cd docker-geneweb
```

```
./main.sh -z
```

Geneweb portal should be running at http://localhost:2317 and setup portal available at http://localhost:2316

## Shutdown
To shutdown the container just run

```docker stop jeffernz-geneweb```

Cleanup the launched container

```docker rm jeffernz-geneweb```

## Export as GEDCOM

To obtain a backup of all the databases in your running GeneWeb container, you can execute

```
docker exec -it jeffernz-geneweb backup.sh
```

The backup will be stored in your home directory under `~/GenealogyData/backup`

## Import from GEDCOM

To import a GEDCOM file into GeneWeb, place the GEDCOM file under `~/GenealogyData/import`
and then execute the import command on the running instance. e.g.

```
docker exec -it jeffernz-geneweb import.sh
```

This will import the GEDCOM file into GeneWeb. Note, all GEDCOM files in the import
folder will be imported. Make sure you remove older files to prevent the database
from being overwritten.

## Export from Geneweb.gw (with Pictures)

To obtain a backup of all the databases with Picture in your running GeneWeb container, you can execute

```
docker exec -it jeffernz-geneweb backup-gw.sh
```

The backup will be stored in your home directory under `~/GenealogyData/backup`


## Import from GEDCOM (with Pictures)

To import a Geneweb.gw file into GeneWeb, place the file.gw under `~/GenealogyData/import`
and then execute the import command on the running instance. e.g.

```
docker exec -it jeffernz-geneweb import-gw.sh
```


## Example file

To try the import export you can play wiht the shakespeare genealogy. Eventually edit the CONTAINER-ID 

```
./copy-examples.sh
```
